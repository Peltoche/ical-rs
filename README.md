# ical-rs

This library parses the `ICalendar` format defined in [RFC5545](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545), as well as
similar formats like `VCard`.

There are probably some issues to be taken care of, but the library should work for most cases. If you would like to help out and
would like to discuss any API changes, please [contact me](dev@halium.fr) or create an issue.

The initial goal was to make a port from the [ical.js](https://github.com/mozilla-comm/ical.js) library in JavaScript and
many code/algorithms was taken from it but in order to but more 'Rusty' a complete rewrite has been made.

## [Documentation](https://peltoche.github.io/ical-rs/ical/)

## Installing

Put this in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ical = "0.7.*"
```


## Overview

There is several ways to use Ical depending on the level of parsing you want. Some new wrapper/formatter could appear in
the next releases.

By default all the features are included but you can choose to include in your project only the needed ones.

#### Warning
  The parsers (PropertyParser / IcalParser) only parse the content and set to uppercase the case-insensitive fields. No checks
  are made on the fields' validity.


### IcalParser / VcardParser

Wrap the result of the PropertyParser into components.

Each component can contain properties (ie: Property) or sub-components.

* The IcalParser return IcalCalendar
* The VcardParser return VcardContact

Cargo.toml:
```toml
[dependencies.ical]
version = "0.7.*"
default-features = false
features = ["ical", "vcard"]
```

Code:
```rust
extern crate ical;

use std::io::BufReader;
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let buf = BufReader::new(File::open("/tmp/component.ics")
        .unwrap());

    let reader = ical::IcalParser::new(buf);

    for line in reader {
        println!("{:?}", line);
    }
}
```

Output:
```
IcalCalendar {
  properties: [],
  events: [
    IcalEvent {
      properties: [ Property { ... }, ... ],
      alarms: [
        IcalAlarm {
          properties: [ Property { ... } ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  alarms: [],
  todos: [],
  journals: [],
  free_busys: [],
  timezones: []
}
```

### PropertyParser

Parse the result of LineReader into three parts:

- The name of the line attribute formatted in uppercase.
- A vector of `(key/value)` tuples for the parameters. The key is formatted in uppercase and the value is untouched.
- The value stays untouched.

It works for both the `Vcard` and `Ical` formats.

#### Example:

Cargo.toml:
```toml
[dependencies.ical]
version = "0.5.*"
default-features = false
features = ["property"]
```

Code:
```rust
extern crate ical;

use std::io::BufReader;
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let buf = BufReader::new(File::open("/tmp/component.ics")
        .unwrap());

    let reader = ical::PropertyParser::from_reader(buf);

    for line in reader {
        println!("{:?}", line);
    }
}
```

Input -> Output:
```
begin:VCALENDAR                           Ok(Property { name: "BEGIN", params: None, value: Some("VCALENDAR") })
ATTENDEE;cn=FooBar:mailto:foo3@bar    ->  Ok(Property { name: "ATTENDEE", params: Some([("CN", "FooBar")]), value: Some("mailto:foo3@bar") })
DESCRIPTION:                              Ok(Property { name: "DESCRIPTION": params: None, value: None })
END:VCALENDAR                             Ok(Property { name: "END", params: None, value: Some("VCALENDAR") })
```

### LineReader

This is a very low level parser. It cleans the empty lines and unfolds them.

It works for both the `Vcard` and `Ical` formats.

#### Example:

Cargo.toml:
```toml
[dependencies.ical]
version = "0.5.*"
default-features = false
features = ["line"]
```

Code:
```rust
extern crate ical;

use std::io::BufReader;
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let buf = BufReader::new(File::open("/tmp/component.ics")
        .unwrap());

    let reader = ical::LineReader::new(buf);

    for line in reader {
        println!("{}", line);
    }
}
```

Input -> Output:

```
BEGIN:VCALENDAR        Line 0: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
BEGIN:VEVENT           Line 1: BEGIN:VEVENT
SUMMARY:foo and   ->   Line 3: SUMMARY:foo andbar
 bar
END:VEVENT             Line 4: END:VEVENT
END:VCALENDAR          Line 5: END:VCALENDAR
```
